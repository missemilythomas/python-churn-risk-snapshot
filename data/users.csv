## Data Preparation & Validation
Before calculating any KPIs, the script performs several cleaning and validation steps to ensure data reliability:

- Standardises all column names to `snake_case`
- Converts churn status from categorical values (`Yes` / `No`) into a numeric `churn_flag` (1 / 0)
- Normalises categorical text fields (trimming whitespace and casing)
- Includes defensive checks to surface unexpected values early

These steps reflect real-world analyst workflows, where validating data quality is as important as the analysis itself.

## Analysis Performed
The script calculates churn metrics grouped by payment behaviour:

- Total users per payment status
- Number of churned customers
- Churn rate per group

This allows a direct comparison between customers who pay on time and those who experience payment delays.

---

## Outputs
Running the script generates two reproducible outputs:

- `outputs/churn_by_payment.csv`  
  Summary table containing users, churned customers, and churn rate by payment status

- `outputs/churn_by_payment.png`  
  Bar chart visualising churn rate by payment status

These outputs can be shared directly with stakeholders or reused in further analysis.

## Key Insight
Customers with delayed payment histories churn at a significantly higher rate than customers who pay on time, indicating that payment friction is a major driver of churn in this dataset.
