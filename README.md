# Churn Risk Snapshot (Python)

## Overview
This mini project uses Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) to produce a concise, reproducible snapshot of customer churn risk.

The focus of this analysis is not predictive modelling, but practical data analyst tasks: cleaning messy data, validating assumptions, calculating key business KPIs, and producing outputs that can be shared with stakeholders.

This project complements the SQL-based churn analysis by demonstrating how Python can be used for automation, validation, and lightweight visualisation.

## Dataset
The analysis uses a Netflix-style customer churn dataset containing customer-level subscription and behaviour data.  
Each row represents a single customer.

Key attributes include:
- Churn status (Yes / No)
- Payment history (On-Time / Delayed)
- Subscription and account details
- Engagement and usage metrics

The raw dataset is not included in this repository.

To run the project locally, place the CSV file in the `data/` folder and name it:


pip install -r requirements.txt
